# Face_Detection
1. Developed a face detection and classification model in MATLAB using eigen faces, eigen values, PCA, and KNN algorithms.
2. Trained the model on a facial image dataset, representing each image with eigen faces and eigen values in a lower-dimensional space using PCA.
3. Utilized the KNN algorithm to classify new facial images into distinct categories by measuring their distance to the training set images in the lower-dimensional space.
4. Attained a high level of accuracy in facial image classification by optimizing the number of eigen faces and principal components in the PCA process.
